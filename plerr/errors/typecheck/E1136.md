## E1136 (unsubscriptable-object)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Value '%s' is unsubscriptable*
  Emitted when a subscripted value doesn't support subscription (i.e. doesn't
  define __getitem__ method or __class_getitem__ for a class). This message
  belongs to the typecheck checker.
