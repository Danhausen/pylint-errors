## W1401 (anomalous-backslash-in-string)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Anomalous backslash in string '%s'. String constant might be missing an r prefix.*
  Used when a backslash is in a literal string but not as an escape. This
  message belongs to the string checker.
