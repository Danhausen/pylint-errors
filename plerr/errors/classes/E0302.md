## E0302 (unexpected-special-method-signature)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *The special method %r expects %s param(s), %d %s given*
  Emitted when a special method was defined with an invalid number of
  parameters. If it has too few or too many, it might not work at all. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
