## W1655 (dict-keys-not-iterating)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *dict.keys referenced when not iterating*
  Used when dict.keys is referenced in a non-iterating context (returns an
  iterator in Python 3) This message belongs to the python3 checker.
