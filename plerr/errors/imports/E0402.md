## E0402 (relative-beyond-top-level)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Attempted relative import beyond top-level package*
  Used when a relative import tries to access too many levels in the current
  package. This message belongs to the imports checker.
