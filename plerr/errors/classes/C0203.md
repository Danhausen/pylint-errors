## C0203 (bad-mcs-method-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Metaclass method %s should have %s as first argument*
  Used when a metaclass method has a first argument named differently than the
  value specified in valid-classmethod-first-arg option (default to "cls"),
  recommended to easily differentiate them from regular instance methods. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
