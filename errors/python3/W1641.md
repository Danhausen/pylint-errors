## W1641 (eq-without-hash)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Implementing __eq__ without also implementing __hash__*
  Used when a class implements __eq__ but not __hash__. In Python 2, objects
  get object.__hash__ as the default implementation, in Python 3 objects get
  None as their default __hash__ implementation if they also implement __eq__.
  This message belongs to the python3 checker.
