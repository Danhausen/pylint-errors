## W1623 (metaclass-assignment)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Assigning to a class's __metaclass__ attribute*
  Used when a metaclass is specified by assigning to __metaclass__ (Python 3
  specifies the metaclass as a class statement argument) This message belongs
  to the python3 checker.
