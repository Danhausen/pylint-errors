## W1643 (idiv-method)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__idiv__ method defined*
  Used when an __idiv__ method is defined. Using `__itruediv__` and
  setting__idiv__ = __itruediv__ should be preferred.(method is not used by
  Python 3) This message belongs to the python3 checker.
