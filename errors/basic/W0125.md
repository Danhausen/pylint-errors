## W0125 (using-constant-test)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using a conditional statement with a constant value*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) uses a constant value
  for its test. This might not be what the user intended to do. This message
  belongs to the basic checker.
