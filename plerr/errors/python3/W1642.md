## W1642 (div-method)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__div__ method defined*
  Used when a __div__ method is defined. Using `__truediv__` and setting__div__
  = __truediv__ should be preferred.(method is not used by Python 3) This
  message belongs to the python3 checker.
