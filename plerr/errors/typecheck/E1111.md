## E1111 (assignment-from-no-return)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Assigning result of a function call, where the function has no return*
  Used when an assignment is done on a function call but the inferred function
  doesn't return anything. This message belongs to the typecheck checker.
