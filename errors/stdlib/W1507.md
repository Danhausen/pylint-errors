## W1507 (shallow-copy-environ)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using copy.copy(os.environ). Use os.environ.copy() instead.*
  os.environ is not a dict object but proxy object, so shallow copy has still
  effects on original object. See https//bugs.python.org/issue15373 for
  reference. This message belongs to the stdlib checker.
