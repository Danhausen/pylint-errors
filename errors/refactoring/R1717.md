## R1717 (consider-using-dict-comprehension)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider using a dictionary comprehension*
  Emitted when we detect the creation of a dictionary using the dict() callable
  and a transient list. Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this
  code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension.Also
  it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list This
  message belongs to the refactoring checker.
