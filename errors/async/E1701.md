## E1701 (not-async-context-manager)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Async context manager '%s' doesn't implement __aenter__ and __aexit__.*
  Used when an async context manager is used with an object that does not
  implement the async context management protocol. This message belongs to the
  async checker. It can't be emitted when using Python < 3.5.
