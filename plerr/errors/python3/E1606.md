## E1606 (long-suffix)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
print(20000005L)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
print(20000005)
```

### Rationale:

Used when `l` or `L` is used to mark a long integer. This will not work in
Python 3, since `int` and `long` types have merged. It can't be emitted when
using Python >= 3.0.
