## W0120 (useless-else-on-loop)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Else clause on loop without a break statement*
  Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break
  statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as
  the loop itself. This message belongs to the basic checker.
