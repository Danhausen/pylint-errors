## W1644 (rdiv-method)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__rdiv__ method defined*
  Used when a __rdiv__ method is defined. Using `__rtruediv__` and
  setting__rdiv__ = __rtruediv__ should be preferred.(method is not used by
  Python 3) This message belongs to the python3 checker.
