## E1610 (non-ascii-bytes-literal)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Non-ascii bytes literals not supported in 3.x*
  Used when non-ascii bytes literals are found in a program. They are no longer
  supported in Python 3. This message belongs to the python3 checker. It can't
  be emitted when using Python >= 3.0.
