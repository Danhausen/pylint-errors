## W0702 (bare-except)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *No exception type(s) specified*
  Used when an except clause doesn't specify exceptions type to catch. This
  message belongs to the exceptions checker.
