## E1129 (not-context-manager)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Context manager '%s' doesn't implement __enter__ and __exit__.*
  Used when an instance in a with statement doesn't implement the context
  manager protocol(__enter__/__exit__). This message belongs to the typecheck
  checker.
