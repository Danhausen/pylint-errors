## W1610 (reduce-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
print(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, range(100)))
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
from functools import reduce
print(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, range(100)))
```

### Rationale:

Used when the reduce built-in function is referenced (missing from Python 3).
