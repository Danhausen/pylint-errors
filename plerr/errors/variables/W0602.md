## W0602 (global-variable-not-assigned)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using global for %r but no assignment is done*
  Used when a variable is defined through the "global" statement but no
  assignment to this variable is done. This message belongs to the variables
  checker.
