## C0414 (useless-import-alias)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Import alias does not rename original package*
  Used when an import alias is same as original package.e.g using import numpy
  as numpy instead of import numpy as np This message belongs to the imports
  checker.
