## R0123 (literal-comparison)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Comparison to literal*
  Used when comparing an object to a literal, which is usually what you do not
  want to do, since you can compare to a different literal than what was
  expected altogether. This message belongs to the basic checker.
