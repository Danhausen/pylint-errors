## R1701 (consider-merging-isinstance)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(%s, (%s))*
  Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one. This
  message belongs to the refactoring checker.
