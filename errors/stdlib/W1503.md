## W1503 (redundant-unittest-assert)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r*
  The first argument of assertTrue and assertFalse is a condition. If a
  constant is passed as parameter, that condition will be always true. In this
  case a warning should be emitted. This message belongs to the stdlib checker.
