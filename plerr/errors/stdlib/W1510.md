## W1510 (subprocess-run-check)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using subprocess.run without explicitly set `check` is not recommended.*
  The check parameter should always be used with explicitly set `check` keyword
  to make clear what the error-handling behavior
  is.https//docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run This
  message belongs to the stdlib checker.
