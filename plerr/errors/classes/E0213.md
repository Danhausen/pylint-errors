## E0213 (no-self-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Method should have "self" as first argument*
  Used when a method has an attribute different the "self" as first argument.
  This is considered as an error since this is a so common convention that you
  shouldn't break it! This message belongs to the classes checker.
