## E1304 (missing-format-string-key)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Missing key %r in format string dictionary*
  Used when a format string that uses named conversion specifiers is used with
  a dictionary that doesn't contain all the keys required by the format string.
  This message belongs to the string checker.
