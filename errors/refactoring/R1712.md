## R1712 (consider-swap-variables)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider using tuple unpacking for swapping variables*
  You do not have to use a temporary variable in order to swap variables. Using
  "tuple unpacking" to directly swap variables makes the intention more clear.
