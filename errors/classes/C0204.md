## C0204 (bad-mcs-classmethod-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Metaclass class method %s should have %s as first argument*
  Used when a metaclass class method has a first argument named differently
  than the value specified in valid-metaclass-classmethod-first-arg option
  (default to "mcs"), recommended to easily differentiate them from regular
  instance methods. This message belongs to the classes checker.
