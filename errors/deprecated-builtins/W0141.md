## W0141 (bad-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Used builtin function %s*
  Used when a black listed builtin function is used (see the bad-function
  option). Usual black listed functions are the ones like map, or filter ,
  where Python offers now some cleaner alternative like list comprehension.
  This message belongs to the deprecated_builtins checker.
