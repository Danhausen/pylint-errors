## W0711 (binary-op-exception)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Exception to catch is the result of a binary "%s" operation*
  Used when the exception to catch is of the form "except A or B". If
  intending to catch multiple, rewrite as "except (A, B)" This message belongs
  to the exceptions checker.
