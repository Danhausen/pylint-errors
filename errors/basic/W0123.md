## W0123 (eval-used)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use of eval*
  Used when you use the "eval" function, to discourage its usage. Consider
  using `ast.literal_eval` for safely evaluating strings containing Python
  expressions from untrusted sources. This message belongs to the basic
  checker.
