## E1606 (long-suffix)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use of long suffix*
  Used when "l" or "L" is used to mark a long integer. This will not work in
  Python 3, since `int` and `long` types have merged. This message belongs to
  the python3 checker. It can't be emitted when using Python >= 3.0.
