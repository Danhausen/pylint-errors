## W0108 (unnecessary-lambda)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Lambda may not be necessary*
  Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same
  argument list as the lambda itself; such lambda expressions are in all but a
  few cases replaceable with the function being called in the body of the
  lambda. This message belongs to the basic checker.
