## W0601 (global-variable-undefined)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Global variable %r undefined at the module level*
  Used when a variable is defined through the "global" statement but the
  variable is not defined in the module scope. This message belongs to the
  variables checker.
