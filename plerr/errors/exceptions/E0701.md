## E0701 (bad-except-order)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Bad except clauses order (%s)*
  Used when except clauses are not in the correct order (from the more specific
  to the more generic). If you don't fix the order, some exceptions may not be
  caught by the most specific handler. This message belongs to the exceptions
  checker.
