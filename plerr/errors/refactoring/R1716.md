## R1716 (chained-comparison)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Simplify chained comparison between the operands*
  This message is emitted when pylint encounters boolean operation like"a < b
  and b < c", suggesting instead to refactor it to "a < b < c" This message
  belongs to the refactoring checker.
