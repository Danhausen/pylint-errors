## C0123 (unidiomatic-typecheck)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using type() instead of isinstance() for a typecheck.*
  The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use
  isinstance(x, Y) rather than type(x) == Y, type(x) is Y. Though there are
  unusual situations where these give different results. This message belongs
  to the basic checker.
