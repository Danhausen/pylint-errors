## R5501 (else-if-used)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider using "elif" instead of "else if"*
  Used when an else statement is immediately followed by an if statement and
  does not contain statements that would be unrelated to it. This message
  belongs to the else_if_used checker.
