## C0411 (wrong-import-order)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *%s should be placed before %s*
  Used when PEP8 import order is not respected (standard imports first, then
  third-party libraries, then local imports) This message belongs to the
  imports checker.
