## C1801 (len-as-condition)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Do not use `len(SEQUENCE)` without comparison to determine if a sequence is empty*
  Used when Pylint detects that len(sequence) is being used without explicit
  comparison inside a condition to determine if a sequence is empty. Instead of
  coercing the length to a boolean, either rely on the fact that empty
  sequences are false or compare the length against a scalar. This message
  belongs to the refactoring checker.
