## W1506 (bad-thread-instantiation)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *threading.Thread needs the target function*
  The warning is emitted when a threading.Thread class is instantiated without
  the target function being passed. By default, the first parameter is the
  group param, not the target param. This message belongs to the stdlib
  checker.
