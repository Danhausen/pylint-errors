## E1302 (mixed-format-string)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Mixing named and unnamed conversion specifiers in format string*
  Used when a format string contains both named (e.g. '%(foo)d') and unnamed
  (e.g. '%d') conversion specifiers. This is also used when a named conversion
  specifier contains * for the minimum field width and/or precision. This
  message belongs to the string checker.
