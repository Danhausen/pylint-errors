## E0203 (access-member-before-definition)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Access to member %r before its definition line %s*
  Used when an instance member is accessed before it's actually assigned. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
