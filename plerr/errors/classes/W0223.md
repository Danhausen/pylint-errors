## W0223 (abstract-method)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Method %r is abstract in class %r but is not overridden*
  Used when an abstract method (i.e. raise NotImplementedError) is not
  overridden in concrete class. This message belongs to the classes checker.
