## W0236 (invalid-overridden-method)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Method %r was expected to be %r, found it instead as %r*
  Used when we detect that a method was overridden in a way that does not match
  its base class which could result in potential bugs at runtime. This message
  belongs to the classes checker.
