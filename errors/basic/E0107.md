## E0107 (nonexistent-operator)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use of the non-existent %s operator*
  Used when you attempt to use the C-style pre-increment or pre-decrement
  operator -- and ++, which doesn't exist in Python. This message belongs to
  the basic checker.
