## W0703 (broad-except)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Catching too general exception %s*
  Used when an except catches a too general exception, possibly burying
  unrelated errors. This message belongs to the exceptions checker.
