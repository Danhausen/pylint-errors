## E0116 (continue-in-finally)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *'continue' not supported inside 'finally' clause*
  Emitted when the `continue` keyword is found inside a finally clause, which
  is a SyntaxError. This message belongs to the basic checker.
