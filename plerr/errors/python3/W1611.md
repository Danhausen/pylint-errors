## W1611 (standarderror-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except StandardError:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Used when the `StandardError` built-in function is referenced (missing from
Python 3).
