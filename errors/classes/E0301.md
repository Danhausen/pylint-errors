## E0301 (non-iterator-returned)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__iter__ returns non-iterator*
  Used when an __iter__ method returns something which is not an iterable (i.e.
  has no `__next__` method) This message belongs to the classes checker.
