## E1126 (invalid-sequence-index)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Sequence index is not an int, slice, or instance with __index__*
  Used when a sequence type is indexed with an invalid type. Valid types are
  ints, slices, and objects with an __index__ method. This message belongs to
  the typecheck checker.
