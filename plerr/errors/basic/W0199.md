## W0199 (assert-on-tuple)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Assert called on a 2-item-tuple. Did you mean 'assert x,y'?*
  A call of assert on a tuple will always evaluate to true if the tuple is not
  empty, and will always evaluate to false if it is. This message belongs to
  the basic checker.
