## W1626 (reload-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *reload built-in referenced*
  Used when the reload built-in function is referenced (missing from Python 3).
  You can use instead imp.reload or importlib.reload. This message belongs to
  the python3 checker.
