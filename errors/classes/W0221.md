## W0221 (arguments-differ)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Parameters differ from %s %r method*
  Used when a method has a different number of arguments than in the
  implemented interface or in an overridden method. This message belongs to the
  classes checker.
