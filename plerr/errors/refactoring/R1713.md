## R1713 (consider-using-join)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider using str.join(sequence) for concatenating strings from an iterable*
  Using str.join(sequence) is faster, uses less memory and increases
  readability compared to for-loop iteration. This message belongs to the
  refactoring checker.
