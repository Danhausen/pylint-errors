## W0105 (pointless-string-statement)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *String statement has no effect*
  Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).
  This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily
  disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of
  comments. This message belongs to the basic checker.
