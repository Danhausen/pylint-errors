## W0222 (signature-differs)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Signature differs from %s %r method*
  Used when a method signature is different than in the implemented interface
  or in an overridden method. This message belongs to the classes checker.
