## W0231 (super-init-not-called)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__init__ method from base class %r is not called*
  Used when an ancestor class method has an __init__ method which is not called
  by a derived class. This message belongs to the classes checker.
