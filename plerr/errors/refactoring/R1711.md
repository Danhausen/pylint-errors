## R1711 (useless-return)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Useless return at end of function or method*
  Emitted when a single "return" or "return None" statement is found at the end
  of function or method definition. This statement can safely be removed
  because Python will implicitly return None This message belongs to the
  refactoring checker.
