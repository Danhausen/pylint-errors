## R1721 (unnecessary-comprehension)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Unnecessary use of a comprehension*
  Instead of using an identitiy comprehension, consider using the list, dict or
  set constructor. It is faster and simpler. This message belongs to the
  refactoring checker.
