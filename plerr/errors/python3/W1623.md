## W1623 (metaclass-assignment)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
from abc import ABCMeta


class Foo(object):
    __metaclass__ = ABCMeta
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
from abc import ABC


class Foo(ABC):
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Used when a metaclass is specified by assigning to `__metaclass__` (Python 3
specifies the metaclass as a class statement argument).
