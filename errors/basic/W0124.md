## W0124 (confusing-with-statement)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Following "as" with another context manager looks like a tuple.*
  Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses
  name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as
  a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager
  returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context
  manager. This message belongs to the basic checker.
