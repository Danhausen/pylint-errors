## W0706 (try-except-raise)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *The except handler raises immediately*
  Used when an except handler uses raise as its first or only operator. This is
  useless because it raises back the exception immediately. Remove the raise
  operator or the entire try-except-raise block! This message belongs to the
  exceptions checker.
