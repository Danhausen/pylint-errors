## R0915 (too-many-statements)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Too many statements (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many statements. You should then split
  it in smaller functions / methods. This message belongs to the design
  checker.
