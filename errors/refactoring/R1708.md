### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Do not raise StopIteration in generator, use return statement instead*
  According to PEP479, the raise of StopIteration to end the loop of a
  generator may lead to hard to find bugs. This PEP specify that raise
  StopIteration has to be replaced by a simple return statement This message
  belongs to the refactoring checker.
