## R0206 (property-with-parameters)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Cannot have defined parameters for properties*
  Used when we detect that a property also has parameters, which are useless,
  given that properties cannot be called with additional arguments. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
