## W0143 (comparison-with-callable)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis?*
  This message is emitted when pylint detects that a comparison with a callable
  was made, which might suggest that some parenthesis were omitted, resulting
  in potential unwanted behaviour. This message belongs to the basic checker.
