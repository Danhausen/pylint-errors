## W0603 (global-statement)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using the global statement*
  Used when you use the "global" statement to update a global variable. Pylint
  just try to discourage this usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it ! This
  message belongs to the variables checker.
