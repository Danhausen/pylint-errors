## W1661 (exception-escape)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using an exception object that was bound by an except handler*
  Emitted when using an exception, that was bound in an except handler, outside
  of the except handler. On Python 3 these exceptions will be deleted once they
  get out of the except handler. This message belongs to the python3 checker.
