## W0235 (useless-super-delegation)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Useless super delegation in method %r*
  Used whenever we can detect that an overridden method is useless, relying on
  super() delegation to do the same thing as another method from the MRO. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
