## C0200 (consider-using-enumerate)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len*
  Emitted when code that iterates with range and len is encountered. Such code
  can be simplified by using the enumerate builtin. This message belongs to the
  refactoring checker.
