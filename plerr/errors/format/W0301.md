## W0301 (unnecessary-semicolon)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Unnecessary semicolon*
  Used when a statement is ended by a semi-colon (";"), which isn't necessary
  (that's python, not C ;). This message belongs to the format checker.
