## W0211 (bad-staticmethod-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Static method with %r as first argument*
  Used when a static method has "self" or a value specified in valid-
  classmethod-first-arg option or valid-metaclass-classmethod-first-arg option
  as first argument. This message belongs to the classes checker.
