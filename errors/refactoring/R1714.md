## R1714 (consider-using-in)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider merging these comparisons with "in" to %r*
  To check if a variable is equal to one of many values,combine the values into
  a tuple and check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of checking
  for equality against each of the values.This is faster and less verbose. This
  message belongs to the refactoring checker.
