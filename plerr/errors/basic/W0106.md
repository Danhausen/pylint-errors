## W0106 (expression-not-assigned)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing*
  Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.
  Probably something else was intended. This message belongs to the basic
  checker.
