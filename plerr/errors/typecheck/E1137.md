### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

 *%r does not support item assignment*
  Emitted when an object does not support item assignment (i.e. doesn't define
  __setitem__ method). This message belongs to the typecheck checker.
