## E1135 (unsupported-membership-test)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Value '%s' doesn't support membership test*
  Emitted when an instance in membership test expression doesn't implement
  membership protocol (__contains__/__iter__/__getitem__). This message belongs
  to the typecheck checker.
