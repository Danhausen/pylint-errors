## W1501 (bad-open-mode)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *"%s" is not a valid mode for open.*
  Python supports r, w, a[, x] modes with b, +, and U (only with r) options.
  See http//docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open This message belongs
  to the stdlib checker.
