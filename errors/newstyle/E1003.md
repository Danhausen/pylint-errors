## E1003 (bad-super-call)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Bad first argument %r given to super()*
  Used when another argument than the current class is given as first argument
  of the super builtin. This message belongs to the newstyle checker.
