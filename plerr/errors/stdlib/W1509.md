## W1509 (subprocess-popen-preexec-fn)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using preexec_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of threads*
  The preexec_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads in
  your application. The child process could deadlock before exec is called. If
  you must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number of libraries you call
  into.https//docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor This
  message belongs to the stdlib checker.
