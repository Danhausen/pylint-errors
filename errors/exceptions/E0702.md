## E0702 (raising-bad-type)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Raising %s while only classes or instances are allowed*
  Used when something which is neither a class, an instance or a string is
  raised (i.e. a `TypeError` will be raised). This message belongs to the
  exceptions checker.
