## W0111 (assign-to-new-keyword)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Name %s will become a keyword in Python %s*
  Used when assignment will become invalid in future Python release due to
  introducing new keyword. This message belongs to the basic checker.
