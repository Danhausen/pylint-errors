## R0203 (no-staticmethod-decorator)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider using a decorator instead of calling staticmethod*
  Used when a static method is defined without using the decorator syntax. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
