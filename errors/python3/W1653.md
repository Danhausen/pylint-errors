## W1653 (next-method-defined)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *next method defined*
  Used when a next method is defined that would be an iterator in Python 2 but
  is treated as a normal function in Python 3. This message belongs to the
  python3 checker.
