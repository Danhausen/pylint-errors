## R0201 (no-self-use)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Method could be a function*
  Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as
  a function. This message belongs to the classes checker.
