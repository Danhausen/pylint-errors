## R1720 (no-else-raise)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Unnecessary "%s" after "raise"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a raise statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a raise statement. This
  message belongs to the refactoring checker.
