## W0312 (mixed-indentation)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Found indentation with %ss instead of %ss*
  Used when there are some mixed tabs and spaces in a module. This message
  belongs to the format checker.
