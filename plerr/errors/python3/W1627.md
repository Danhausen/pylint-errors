## W1627 (oct-method)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__oct__ method defined*
  Used when an __oct__ method is defined (method is not used by Python 3) This
  message belongs to the python3 checker.
