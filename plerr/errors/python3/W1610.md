## W1610 (reduce-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *reduce built-in referenced*
  Used when the reduce built-in function is referenced (missing from Python 3)
  This message belongs to the python3 checker.
