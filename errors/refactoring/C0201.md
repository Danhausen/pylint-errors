## C0201 (consider-iterating-dictionary)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Consider iterating the dictionary directly instead of calling .keys()*
  Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the .keys()
  method. It is enough to just iterate through the dictionary itself, as in
  "for key in dictionary". This message belongs to the refactoring checker.
