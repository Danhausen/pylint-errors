## W1619 (old-division)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used for non-floor division w/o a float literal or
`from __future__ import division` (Python 3 returns a float for int division
unconditionally).
