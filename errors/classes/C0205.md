## C0205 (single-string-used-for-slots)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Class __slots__ should be a non-string iterable*
  Used when a class __slots__ is a simple string, rather than an iterable. This
  message belongs to the classes checker.
