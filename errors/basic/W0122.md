## W0122 (exec-used)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use of exec*
  Used when you use the "exec" statement (function for Python 3), to discourage
  its usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it ! This message belongs to the
  basic checker.
