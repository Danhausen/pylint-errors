### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Cell variable %s defined in loop*
  A variable used in a closure is defined in a loop. This will result in all
  closures using the same value for the closed-over variable. This message
  belongs to the variables checker.
