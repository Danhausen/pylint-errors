## R0904 (too-many-public-methods)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Too many public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class. This message belongs to the design
  checker.
