## C0103 (invalid-name)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *%s name "%s" doesn't conform to %s*
  Used when the name doesn't conform to naming rules associated to its type
  (constant, variable, class...). This message belongs to the basic checker.
