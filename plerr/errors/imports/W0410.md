## W0410 (misplaced-future)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *__future__ import is not the first non docstring statement*
  Python 2.5 and greater require __future__ import to be the first non
  docstring statement in the module. This message belongs to the imports
  checker.
