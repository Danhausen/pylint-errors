## W1202 (logging-format-interpolation)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string.format(format_args...))". Use another type of string
  formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the
  logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-
  interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-
  not-lazy is disabled then you can use % formatting as normal. This message
  belongs to the logging checker.
