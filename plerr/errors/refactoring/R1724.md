## R1724 (no-else-continue)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Unnecessary "%s" after "continue"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a continue statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a continue statement.
  This message belongs to the refactoring checker.
