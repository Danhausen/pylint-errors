## E0118 (used-prior-global-declaration)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Name %r is used prior to global declaration*
  Emitted when a name is used prior a global declaration, which results in an
  error since Python 3.6. This message belongs to the basic checker. It can't
  be emitted when using Python < 3.6.
