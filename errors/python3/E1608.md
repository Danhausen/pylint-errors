## E1608 (old-octal-literal)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use of old octal literal*
  Used when encountering the old octal syntax, removed in Python 3. To use the
  new syntax, prepend 0o on the number. This message belongs to the python3
  checker. It can't be emitted when using Python >= 3.0.
