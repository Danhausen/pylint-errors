## E1303 (format-needs-mapping)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Expected mapping for format string, not %s*
  Used when a format string that uses named conversion specifiers is used with
  an argument that is not a mapping. This message belongs to the string
  checker.
