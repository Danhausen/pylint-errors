## E0119 (misplaced-format-function)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *format function is not called on str*
  Emitted when format function is not called on str object. e.g doing
  print("value {}").format(123) instead of print("value {}".format(123)).
  This might not be what the user intended to do. This message belongs to the
  basic checker.
