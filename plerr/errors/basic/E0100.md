### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python

```

### Rationale:

 *__init__ method is a generator*
  Used when the special class method __init__ is turned into a generator by a
  yield in its body. This message belongs to the basic checker.
