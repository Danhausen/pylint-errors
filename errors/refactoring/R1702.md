## R1702 (too-many-nested-blocks)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Too many nested blocks (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the
  code less understandable and maintainable. This message belongs to the
  refactoring checker.
