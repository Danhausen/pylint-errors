## C0122 (misplaced-comparison-constant)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Comparison should be %s*
  Used when the constant is placed on the left side of a comparison. It is
  usually clearer in intent to place it in the right hand side of the
  comparison. This message belongs to the basic checker.
