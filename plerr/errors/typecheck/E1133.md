### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Non-iterable value %s is used in an iterating context*
  Used when a non-iterable value is used in place where iterable is expected
  This message belongs to the typecheck checker.
