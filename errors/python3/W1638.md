## W1638 (range-builtin-not-iterating)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *range built-in referenced when not iterating*
  Used when the range built-in is referenced in a non-iterating context
  (returns a range in Python 3) This message belongs to the python3 checker.
