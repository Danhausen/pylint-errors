## E1607 (old-ne-operator)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Use of the <> operator*
  Used when the deprecated "<>" operator is used instead of "!=". This is
  removed in Python 3. This message belongs to the python3 checker. It can't be
  emitted when using Python >= 3.0.
