## W1632 (input-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *input built-in referenced*
  Used when the input built-in is referenced (backwards-incompatible semantics
  in Python 3) This message belongs to the python3 checker.
