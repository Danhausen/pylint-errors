## W1640 (using-cmp-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Using the cmp argument for list.sort / sorted*
  Using the cmp argument for list.sort or the sorted builtin should be avoided,
  since it was removed in Python 3. Using either `key` or
  `functools.cmp_to_key` should be preferred. This message belongs to the
  python3 checker.
