## W0716 (wrong-exception-operation)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Invalid exception operation. %s*
  Used when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation is not
  valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having binary
  operations between exceptions in except handlers. This message belongs to the
  exceptions checker.
