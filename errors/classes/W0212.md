## W0212 (protected-access)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

 *Access to a protected member %s of a client class*
  Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an
  underscore) is access outside the class or a descendant of the class where
  it's defined. This message belongs to the classes checker.
